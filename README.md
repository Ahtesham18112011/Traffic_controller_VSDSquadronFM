# Traffic Light Controller
A **traffic light controller using FPGA** is a digital system implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to manage the operation of traffic lights at an intersection. It controls the sequence and timing of traffic signals (red, yellow, green) to ensure smooth and safe traffic flow. FPGAs are used because they offer flexibility, high-speed processing, and the ability to implement custom logic for real-time control.

### Key Components and Functionality
1. **FPGA**: A programmable hardware device that allows designers to implement custom digital circuits using hardware description languages (HDL) like VHDL or Verilog.
2. **State Machine**: The controller typically uses a finite state machine (FSM) to define the sequence of light changes (e.g., Green → Yellow → Red → Green for each direction).
3. **Timing Control**: Timers are implemented to manage the duration of each light phase (e.g., 30 seconds for green, 5 seconds for yellow).
4. **Inputs**:
   - Clock signal for timing.
   - Sensors (e.g., vehicle or pedestrian detectors) to adapt to traffic conditions.
   - Manual inputs (e.g., emergency override).
5. **Outputs**:
   - Signals to control the traffic lights (e.g., turning on/off red, yellow, green LEDs or relays).
6. **Optional Features**:
   - Adaptive control based on traffic density.
   - Pedestrian crossing signals.
   - Emergency vehicle priority.

### How It Works
- The FPGA is programmed with HDL code to define the logic of the traffic light sequence.
- The FSM cycles through states (e.g., "North-South Green," "North-South Yellow," "East-West Green") based on timers or sensor inputs.
- The FPGA processes inputs in real-time and sends appropriate signals to the traffic lights.
- The design can be reconfigured for different intersections or traffic patterns by updating the FPGA's programming.

### Advantages of Using FPGA
- **Customizability**: Easily modify timing or logic for specific intersections.
- **Speed**: FPGAs process signals in parallel, ensuring low-latency control.
- **Reliability**: Hardware-based implementation is robust and less prone to software crashes.
- **Scalability**: Can handle complex intersections with multiple lanes or pedestrian signals.

### Example Workflow
1. **Design**: Create an FSM in VHDL/Verilog to define light sequences (e.g., Green for 30s, Yellow for 5s, Red for 35s).
2. **Simulation**: Test the design using tools like ModelSim to verify timing and logic.
3. **Synthesis**: Use FPGA tools (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Altera Quartus) to map the design to the FPGA.
4. **Implementation**: Load the design onto the FPGA and connect it to the traffic light hardware.
5. **Testing**: Verify operation in a real or simulated intersection.

### Applications
- Urban traffic management.
- Smart traffic systems with sensor-based adaptive control.
- Educational projects for learning digital design and FPGA programming.
